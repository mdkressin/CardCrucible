     Players must war to determine a round winner, with the winner receiving all of the cards used during the duration of the war..
     
     There are two kinds of situations that can occur when two or more players go to war.
        1. _One or more players possess enough cards to participate in a complete round of war._ In this situation, if any of the other players do not have enough cards left to participate in a complete war, then they are eliminated from the game and their cards are added to the array of `prizeCards` to be given to the eventual winner of the war. The remaining players place down the necessary amount of cards needed to war, with the final card that each player placed used to determine the outcome of the war. If a player's final placed card is the sole card with the highest rank, then that player wins the war and all cards in `prizeCards` are added to that player's cards. Otherwise, all players in the war who placed final cards of the highest, equivalent rank participate in another war.
        2. _None of the players have enough cards to participate in a complete round of war._ In this situation, the players participating in the war use of all of their remaining to war. Any players that have less cards remaining than other players are eliminated from the game and have all of their cards added to `prizeCards`. The players who have not been eliminated then compare the final cards that they place. If there is a sole final card that has the highest rank in the war, then the player who placed the card wins the war and all cards in `prizeCards` are added to their cards. Otherwise, the war ends in a draw
